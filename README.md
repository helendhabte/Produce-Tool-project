# Produce-Tool-Project

This was intially a project I did in an undergraduate class on R fundametals. 
The version of the project I found recently was incomplete, and had a lot of syntax errors.
I will complete re-executing the project using Python, I plan to also expanded and optimized many of the features.
I revisited this project in order to get some practice with coding basics in Python.

This project is suppose to be a managerial tool that provides the price of vegetables, shipping cost, and an end of day summary.
When you run the code you will be promoted to enter pounds of produce. From there you can perform the following options:

Submit
- Yields produce price and shipping cost

Summary
- After submitting orders (pounds of produce) yields total produce price, average produce price, and a count of orders

Reset
- This will direct you back to the menu

Exit
- Exit Application
